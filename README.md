# Levi Spellmeyer's complete project portfolio
This repository is a complete collection of my work/projects that I have completed and am curently working on.
Each individual project will have a single dedicated folder that includes any source code as well as documentation of my process, what I learned from the project, and challenges I faced while working.
Note: Not every project is a coding project, therefore some folders may only contain documentation and notes.
